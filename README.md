# Master thesis - "Fleeing the floods: the local health effects of internally displaced Malawians"

My group Master thesis (co-authored with Laura Prudencio, María Suárez and Benjamin English) focused on identifying the effects of interally displaced peoples (IDPs) on the health of host communities following Cyclone Idai in Malawi. Data download, wrangling and analysis was conducted using R.
